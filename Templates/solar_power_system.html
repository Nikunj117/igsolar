                       <p>nce you install a Solar Battery, the excess energy generated by your solar panels will be sent to your battery. Battery stores the sunâ€™s energy throughout the day, often when you are at work or not at home. You can then schedule the battery to deliver the stored power to your house when you need it most, such as peak times at night when the sun has gone down. This puts you in control of your power and drastically reduces your power bills saving a lot smartly.</p>
